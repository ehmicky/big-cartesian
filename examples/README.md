This directory contains [examples](main.js) of this library.

To execute them, first [install](../README.md#install) `big-cartesian`. Then run
`node node_modules/big-cartesian/examples/main.js`.

You can edit the examples.

They can also be run directly
[in your browser](https://repl.it/@ehmicky/big-cartesian).
